          <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates among men and women at the state level between 1981 and 2013. It finds a significant relationship between firearm ownership levels in a state and firearm-related suicide for both men and women. However, the relationship between firearm ownership and total suicide rates was found only for male suicide rates, not female suicide rates.</p>

          <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household gun ownership and rates of homicide among women at the state level during the period 1981-2013. It finds a significant, positive relationship between household gun ownership levels in a state and higher homicide rates. This relationship is specific to firearm-related homicide and to non-stranger homicide and is not observed with non-firearm-related homicide or stranger homicide.</p>

          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>The State Firearm Laws project aims to provide researchers with the data necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of
            various firearm laws. By carefully monitoring how gun legislation impacts firearm-related violence, we can provide
            policymakers with the evidence they need to make gun ownership safer for everyone.</p>
          <p>Our team is led by Dr. Michael Siegel, a Professor in the Community Health Sciences Department of the Boston
            University School of Public Health. Dr. Michael Siegel has extensive experience in firearms research, having
            published eight articles regarding the relationship between gun ownership and firearm violence.</p>
          <p>The State Firearm Laws team is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. For more information, contact:
