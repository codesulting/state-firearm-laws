5. We will update the data to correspond to the new spreadsheet you
sent. We can do this over the weekend at the latest (by Monday morning,
the data should be up to date).

8. Should the state page fact sheet PDFs be linked from each state page?
We can probably do this by Friday, if necessary.

9. Under "Law Data", you have "Read the Manuscript" and "Read the
Report". I assume the latter should link to the report PDF. Is "Read the
Manuscript" the same (and should we remove that menu item from that
drop-down menu)?

use contact@statefirearmlaws.org?

slight changes to SAIL text

where is manuscript link?
