      <p>This article examines the nature and outcome of firearm-related hospitalizations at Pennsylvania trauma centers during the period 2003-2015. The results suggest that while the rate of firearm-related hospitalizations is declining, the severity of firearm-related injuries may be increasing.</p>

      <p>This article examines trends in overall, firearm-related, and non-firearm-related suicide rates in the United States during the period 1999-2015 in relation to state universal background check and mandatory waiting period laws. It concludes that the absence of universal background check and mandatory waiting period laws is associated with more pronounced increases in suicide rates over the study period.</p>

      <p>This article reports the results of a national online survey of U.S. adults to ascertain their opinions regarding whether carrying firearms should be allowed in various public places.

      <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household gun ownership and total, firearm-related, and non-firearm-related suicide rates at the state level in the year 2013. It finds that after controlling for a wide range of state-level factors, household gun ownership levels are associated with significantly higher rates of overall and firearm-related suicide.</p>

      <p>This article compared changes in state suicide rates from 2013 to 2014 in relation to the presence or absence of state universal background check and mandatory waiting period laws. It finds that the presence of these laws was associated with significantly greater declines (or smaller increases) in suicide rates over the one-year study period.</p>

      <p>This article reports the results of a national survey of gun owners to determine the percentage of gun owners who acquired their last firearm without a background check. It found that of firearms acquired during the past two years, 22% were purchased without a background check. This proportion was substantially higher in states without laws that regulate private gun sales.</p>
