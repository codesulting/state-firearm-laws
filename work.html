      <p>This article reports trends in fatal and non-fatal firearm-related injuries from 2001 to 2013 and documents a sharp rise in non-fatal injuries during this period.</p>

      <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates among men and women at the state level between 1981 and 2013. It finds a significant relationship between firearm ownership levels in a state and firearm-related suicide for both men and women. However, the relationship between firearm ownership and total suicide rates was found only for male suicide rates, not female suicide rates.</p>

      <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household gun ownership and rates of homicide among women at the state level during the period 1981-2013. It finds a significant, positive relationship between household gun ownership levels in a state and higher homicide rates. This relationship is specific to firearm-related homicide and to non-stranger homicide and is not observed with non-firearm-related homicide or stranger homicide.</p>

      <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household firearm ownership and stranger and nonstranger firearm homicide rates at the state level between 1981 and 2010. It finds a significant positive relationship between firearm ownership levels and non-stranger homicides, but no significant relationship between firearm ownership levels and stranger homicide.</p>

      <p>This article uses a newly developed proxy for state-level, household firearm ownership to re-examine the relationship between gun ownership levels and homicide rates at the state level between 1981 and 2010. It finds that gun ownership levels, as measured by this new proxy, are associated with significantly higher rates of total and firearm-related homicide but are not significantly associated with non-firearm homicide rates.</p>

      <p>This article examines the relationship between levels of household gun ownership and firearm-related homicide rates at the state level between 1981 and 2010. After controlling for a wide range of state-level factors, it finds that states with higher levels of household firearm ownership have significantly higher rates of firearm-related homicide.</p>

      <p>This article presents and validates a new proxy variable that can be used to estimate state-level, household firearm ownership prevalence. This new proxy improves the correlation with survey-measured household firearm ownership from 0.80 to 0.95 and more closely approximates the absolute levels of gun ownership.</p>

      <p>This article attempts to identify differences in factors related to firearm-related homicides-suicides compared to firearm-related suicides alone using data from the National Vital Death Registry from 2003 to 2011. It finds that interpersonal conflict and recent crisis are specific risk factors for firearm-related homicides-suicides.</p>
